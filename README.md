This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# NextJS + Redux-Saga + TypeScript + Material-UI 
## Boilerplate Template

## Description of Architecture
```
TypeScript configuration

Material-UI theme configured

Starting point for state with Redux-Saga

Model, response, and page state types

Basic load/complete/error actions and reducer

Saga to call API and dispatch completed/error states

"Isomorphic" API usable via fetch from the client or directly in getServerSideProps

Server Side Rendering support with Redux thanks to next-redux-wrapper

Helper Functions

A few handy common utilities like Input and Loader components

```

## How to get started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
